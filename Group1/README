Deliverable 1: This is unchanged from the provided example. 

Rscript --vanilla actual_separability.R human_pancreas.loom activated_stellate quiescent_stellate

Deliverable 2: This is provided as the bash script predicted_separability.sh. It makes two calls: one to the R script prediction_metrics.R which featurizes the input loom file and one to predict-separability.py which makes the separability predictions based on the trained model.

bash predicted_separability.sh human_pancreas_activated_quiescent_stellate.loom 0.03 0.02 predictions.tsv

NOTE: this script expects the test loom files to be in the same directory the script is run from.
